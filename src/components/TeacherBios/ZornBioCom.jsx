            Hi! My name is Cheryl Zorn, and I am a VPK Assistant here at First
            Christian Preschool. I have been married for 43 years, and have two
            children, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. I was in
            the business world for 30 years. The highlights of my career have
            been in office administration and accounting management. I have also
            been teaching children of all ages for 20 plus years: from VBS age,
            all the way up to youth group. Although my career has always been
            elsewhere, I certainly feel called by God to Early Childhood
            Development. I have enjoyed teaching at First Christian Preschool
            since 2017. I am excited to continue on this path God has for me and
            I canâ€™t wait to see your children grow in Jesus!
