            Hello! My name is Mrs. Jami and as the Threes B teacher, I just want
            to share how excited I am for the opportunity to pour love and
            wisdom into your little one. My approach in the classroom is to
            treat each childâ€™s needs individually. I love to sing and play and
            to be silly- I believe that laughter brings joy and joy is an
            essential component of development. I love teaching little ones
            about Jesus, teaching them to pray, and showing them how to exhibit
            kindness and care. To me, being a wife and a mother is the most
            important role in my life, so I am happy to work in a place where I
            can use those skills of nurturing, maintaining order, and sharing
            the heart of God with the most precious beings on earth- all while
            my own little one learns in the classroom next door!
