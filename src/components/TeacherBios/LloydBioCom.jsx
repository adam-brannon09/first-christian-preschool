            Hi! My name is Katelyn Lloyd and I am the Twoâ€™s teacher here at
            First Christian Preschool. I was born and raised in DeFuniak and
            spent 4 years in Pensacola where I got my start in the early
            childhood field. I absolutely love teaching and learning about child
            development, getting to watch children learn and grow into
            themselves is what I enjoy most about working with children. I enjoy
            spending time with my family and pets, gardening, reading, and
            traveling. I currently have 3 pets: a dog Circe, a cat Toro, and a
            crested gecko named Astrid. I love to learn and working children you
            are constantly learning new things about them, yourself and the
            world we live in! I am super excited to get to teach and care for
            your children.
