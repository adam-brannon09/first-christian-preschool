            Hello! My name is Katelyn Lloyd, and I am the Three-Year-Old Teacher
            here at First Christian Preschool. I was born and raised in DeFuniak
            Springs and spent four years in Pensacola, where I began my journey
            in the early childhood education field. I absolutely love teaching
            and have a deep passion for child development. Watching children
            learn, grow, and discover who they are is one of the greatest joys
            of my job! In my free time, I enjoy being with my family and pets,
            gardening, reading, and traveling. I have three dogs, two cats, and
            two hamsters! I believe that working with children is a constant
            learning experienceâ€”you not only teach them, but they also teach you
            so much about life, joy, and curiosity. I am so excited to teach and
            care for your little ones and to be a part of their journey here at
            FCP!
