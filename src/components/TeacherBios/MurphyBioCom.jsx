            Hello, my name is April Murphy. It is an honor to introduce myself
            as the Director of First Christian Preschool. I look forward to
            partnering with teachers and parents to provide our students with a
            superior childcare experience that allows them to thrive
            academically, socially, and spiritually. Prior to First Christian
            Preschool, I have had the opportunity to teach in many wonderful
            places and meet many exceptional people. My favorite part about my
            job is being able to love Jesus and show that love to the children
            here at FCP! My Early Childhood journey has spanned over 25 years,
            and I enjoy bringing those experiences to FCP. I was awarded my
            National Early Childhood Credential in 2005 and a Directorâ€™s
            Credential in 2014. In 2008, we moved from the BIG city to a very
            small town called Darlington, where we have embraced country living.
            I married my husband Larry, a chef, in 1994, and together we enjoy
            our children: Brendon, Kymberlyn, and Griffon. Brendon blessed our
            family with identical twin girls, Alice and Amelia in 2019, and is
            planning a wedding for later this year. Kymberlyn married her
            husband, James in December 2022, and she enjoys teaching at FCP and
            traveling. Griffon married his wife, Mercedes in 2021 and they had
            our first grandson, Henry in 2022. They are also expecting another
            baby boy this July. I get great joy from loving my children and
            being a Honey to my grandchildren! We also enjoy our Chocolate Labs,
            Reece and Rollyns, who require a lot of our attention! In my free
            time, I enjoy watching NY Giants football, traveling, and shopping!!
