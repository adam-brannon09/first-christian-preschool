            Hi my name is Belle Lloyd and I am the Twoâ€™s teacher at First
            Christian Preschool. I have been working in childcare for the past 3
            years and have loved every minute of it! I was born and raised in
            DeFuniak Springs and am so excited to be back after being in
            Pensacola for the past 4 years. I love animals and have two dogs,
            Circe and Winnie, a cat named Toro, and a crested gecko named
            Astrid! I have 5 siblings and love spending time with them. I have
            always loved learning from and teaching children! Children see the
            world in such interesting ways and are a joy to watch learn and to
            learn from them. I am so excited for the journey that I will have at
            this wonderful school and all the things I will learn from your
            children!
