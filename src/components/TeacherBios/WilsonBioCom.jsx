            Hello! My name is Brittany Wilson and I am a Preschool Assistant
            here at First Christian Preschool! After my oldest son attended FCP,
            we immediately fell in love with this staff and atmosphere! I am
            thankful to watch my boys grow up and be a part of the FCP family. I
            was born and raised in Florida! My husband and I , who are high
            school sweethearts, have been married since 2016 and we enjoy our
            two boys: Easton and Fletcher. We enjoy life on our farm in Mossy
            Head where we love all things outdoors! From our buggy rides,
            hunting, fishing and camping adventures. I am so excited to join
            this school and canâ€™t wait to start this chapter!
