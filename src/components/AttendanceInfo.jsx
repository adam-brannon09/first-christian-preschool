        <p>
          Attendance statements will be sent home each month to track absences. Absences are not categorized as excused or unexcused. An absence is an absence. 
          According to our contract with the state, children may not exceed 30 absences per school year. If this limit is exceeded, VPK services will be terminated at FCP.

        <h3 className="font-bold">Field Trips</h3>
        <p>
          Field trips are considered instructional school days and count toward attendance. Missing a field trip day will count as an absence.

        <p>
          Closures due to emergencies or weather count toward the 30-day absence limit unless credited by the state. 
          We are usually notified of credits the following month. If credited, they will not count against your child's total absences.
